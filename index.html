			Hello! I am building a professional(sarcastic) website. Partly for practice, but also
			because people apparently want to look at one of these when you are seeking a job as a front-end developer! Me personally?
			I don't care...I couldn't care less. But if I'm going to build one I better damn well like how it looks!
			</p>
			<p>That being said...who knows? I might blog, I may very well use this as a portfolio. So hey; no harm, right?</p>
